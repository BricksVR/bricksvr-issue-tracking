# Reporting an issue

You've found a bug? Awesome! There's a few steps we need you to follow to help keep bug reports organized.

### Sign up

If you don't have a GitHub account, create one for free by heading to https://github.com/signup

### Check for duplicates

Please always check for duplicates before making an issue. We close all duplicates, and we don't want you to waste your time writing out a big issue that's just going to get deleted. Head to the `issues` tab and use the search bar to see if a similar bug has been reported. If you find an existing issue, feel free to add a reaction or a comment if you have anything to add.

### Head to the new issues page

Under the issues tab, click the big green "New Issue" button on the right.

### Use the appropriate template

Pick the bug report or feature request template depending on what type of issue you're making. In the template, the lines beginning with #'s are the prompts. Replace the text below each prompt with your answer. **Be as descriptive as possible, include reproduction steps if possible, and include screenshots or video recording if you have any**. These help us solve issues much faster.

### That's it!

We'll take it from there. You may get an email from GitHub if we ask a follow up question. An issue is a place for conversation, so if we ask a followup, you can respond in a comment in your issue.

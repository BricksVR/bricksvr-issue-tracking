## Hand Spawners

A, B, X and Y each control a "hand spawner". Hand spawners can be used to spawn bricks without needing to walk back and forth between the table. Each button can be mapped to a different brick.

To select a brick, hover over a brick (you should see an outline) and hold down the button. The controller will vibrate when the brick has been selected.

To spawn a brick, simply press the button. If you press the button while holding the grab button, the brick will spawn right into your hand.

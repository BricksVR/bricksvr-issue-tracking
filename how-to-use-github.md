# How to use GitHub

New to GitHub? This guide will show you the parts you need to know for the alpha.

### Repositories

https://github.com/BricksVR/bricksvr-alpha is our repository, it represents a single "project". GitHub repositories can also include source code but we have our source code elsewhere.

### Issues

Issues are where we have discussions about the repository. Issues are more persistent and long-term than Discord issues, so we should put anything we might want to track long term in GitHub instead of Discord, it helps prevent things from getting lost in the Discord noise.

An issue is not only used for "problems". Right now we have templates for "bugs" and "feature requests", but we can also have any other sort of discussion on GitHub. The name is misleading, don't let the word "issue" make it seem like only problems or go in the issues tab.

### Spam / Off topic discussion

GitHub is not a place for memes, spam, or other off topic discussion. This is where engineers organize and prioritize work, so we need to keep it clean and organized. Please keep this stuff in the Discord, and feel free to DM me if you're unsure if you should make an issue or not.

## Thats all!

Every other tab and functionality of the GitHub repo is not important for this alpha. If you're curious about anything else, feel free to ask on Discord, I'd be happy to help.
